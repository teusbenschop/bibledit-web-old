Optimizing MySQL tables and queries.


Query Optimization

Turn on slow query log and make it log queries that don't use indexes.
File my.cnf needs the following lines:

log_slow_queries  = /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log
long_query_time  = 1
log-queries-not-using-indexes


Explain Queries

Does the query use indexes?
Find out:

EXPLAIN EXTENDED SELECT id, chapter FROM data WHERE bible = 1 \G;


Indexes or Table Scanning

If the tables does not have an index, MySQL will scan through each row.
This places stress on the disk system.
For small tables it is more efficient for MySQL to scan a table rather than use an index


Let the Application do the Work

Usually it is better to ask the database to do as little as is possible,
and move processing into the application.


Lock Contention in MyISAM or InnoDB

mysql> show status like 'Table_locks_waited';

+--------------------+-------+
| Variable_name      | Value |
+--------------------+-------+
| Table_locks_waited | 23412 |
+--------------------+-------+

A large or growing Table_locks_waited value means there is a serious concurrency bottleneck.
