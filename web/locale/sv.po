msgid ""
"It allows for more efficient usage of paper, and for more regular appearance "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The details of hyphenating properly are complex and dependent on the "
"language, and can interact with other orthographic and typesetting practices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Hyphenation may not be so important when preparing a Bible for proofreading. "
"It is usually regarded important for production quality Bibles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When preparing a Bible in LibreOffice, OpenOffice, AbiWord, en so on, the "
"wordprocessor itself provides hyphenation algorithms for many languages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no suitable hyphenation algorithm can be used, perhaps Bibledit-Web can "
"assist to a limited degree."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bibledit-Web can take the data from a Bible, insert soft hyphens in the "
"words according to a certain algorithm, and then save this data as a new "
"Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This new Bible can then be exported to OpenDocument format, and opened in a "
"wordprocessor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The wordprocessor sees these soft hyphens. When a soft hyphen occurs near "
"the end of the line, it breaks the word there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bibledit-Web has one hyphenating algorithm. When there is a transition in "
"the text from any character of a first set of characters, to any character "
"of a second set of characters, then the soft hyphen will be inserted at that "

msgid "Scrum-based Translation"
msgstr ""

msgid "What is Scrum-based translation?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A translation team that works with Scrum frequently releases portions of "
"translated Scripture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This makes it clear to involved parties where the translation project is "
"going."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It enables the translation team to make course corrections based on the "
"facts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Burndown charts and the product backlog provide the product owner and others "
"with a permanent overview over the translation status and progress."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Scrum is an agile process that enables self-organizing translation teams to "
"deliver high translation output and accuracy in a short time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using iterative translation, it releases portions of translated Scripture "
"every iteration, that is, every month."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the end of the every sprint, anyone can see the translated portion, and "
"decide whether to release it to the congregations and community for feedback "
"or continue to enhance it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The introduction and the following explanation just outlines the mechanics "
"of Scrum-based Translation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It does not make clear what difficulties and issues you will run into trying "
"to implement it."
msgstr ""

msgid "It only hints at the agile spirit that's required to make it work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're interested in implementing Scrum-based translation, do some "
"reading, watch videos, follow a course, find a mentor or coach."
msgstr ""

msgid "Product Owner"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Product Owner represents the stakeholders."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He or she is the voice of the target audience, that is the Bible reader."
msgstr ""

msgid "He understands the requirements for the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Product Owner may also be a group of people in a committee."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He is responsible for ensuring that the team delivers accuracy and "
"reliability to the Bible translation."
msgstr ""

msgid "He knows about accuracy and reliability."
msgstr ""

msgid "He defines items that focus on desired features."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He makes decisions as to whether to implement footnotes or leave them out."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the same way, he defines other features, like headers, introductions, or "
"decides to leave them out."
msgstr ""

msgid "He decides about use or non-use of a dialect."
msgstr ""

msgid "He sets the priorities for the work to be done."
msgstr ""

msgid "He adds the items to the product backlog."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scrum teams should have one Product Owner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Product Owner may be part of the Translation Team, but it is recommended "
"that his role not be combined with the role of Scrum Master."
msgstr ""

msgid "Release Planning"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The release planning shows which parts of the Bible will be translated and "
"delivered during which Sprint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is convenient to define a Sprint in months, so that the release planning "
"mentions January, February, and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is often helpful to stick the release planning to the wall so that "
"everybody can see the grand picture."
msgstr ""

msgid "The advantages of a release planning are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. It gives the team a common vision about what needs to be achieved, and "
"when."
msgstr ""

msgid "2. It guides the team to make decisions during detailed planning."
msgstr ""

msgid "3. It helps prioritize the actions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"4. It resolves conflicts and guides the teams toward the right balance on "
"trade-offs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Release each completed Bible book to the community and get their feedback."
msgstr ""

msgid "This implements the important principle of continual improvement."
msgstr ""

msgid "The release planning is a simple way of doing top-down planning."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is an estimate, simple and quick to do."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is based on the Product Backlog."
msgstr ""

msgid "Product Backlog"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The product backlog is an ordered list of requirements that is maintained "
"for the Bible translation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It consists of translation tasks, checking tasks, testing tasks, "
"comprehension tasks, whatever needs to be done to deliver a reliable "
"manuscript."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Product Owner prioritizes the items on this list."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is used to determine the work for the next sprints."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each item has an associated estimated time to complete."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint"
msgstr ""

msgid "A sprint typically takes one month."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is where the translaton work (translate, review, approve, test) occurs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each member of the team translates independently and in a responsible manner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In case a translator is sure of a required change, he enters it without "
"consulting others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a translator thinks a proposed change needs discussion, he notifies his "
"colleagues."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All members of the translation team review the changes made by the team."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is to make sure that all changes are reviewed by all members, that no "
"mistakes occur."
msgstr ""

msgid "The reviews take place every day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This way of working is based on personal responsibility and mutual trust."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It speeds up the translation procedure because there's more actual "
"translation work going on, and less discussions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The newer members of the team learn from the more experienced ones through "
"the daily reviews."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bibledit-Web has the concept of daily Change Notifications."
msgstr ""

msgid "A member can opt to receive the Change Notifications through email."
msgstr ""

msgid "This email can be viewed online also."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Or a member can opt to have the Change Notifications generated for him "
"online, and can review and approve them there."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Planning Meeting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During this meeting the team selects the portions to translate, review and "
"test it believes it can commit to in a sprint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The team breaks the portions down into tasks and provided estimates for "
"those tasks as to the time it takes to complete them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Backlog"
msgstr ""

msgid "The sprint backlog is a list of tasks to be completed in a sprint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The tasks are created by breaking down the product backlog items during the "
"planning meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid "The tasks have estimates in hours or days associated with them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a team it is vitally important to have a clear goal to work towards."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thus everybody is focused on the desired outcome, and keeps a good pace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Without a clear goal, the team may still do a lot of things and work hard, "
"but the produced results may have the desired value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Team"
msgstr ""

"The following needs consideration if the Bible includes more than one book. "
"Does the next book follow on the same page on which the previous book "
"finished, or do the books follow on from one another in a different way? "
"Whatever method is chosen, it needs to be applied consistently throughout "
"the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Line spacing should be consistent throughout and should be placed line on "
"line across all pages. It means that they should all line up with each other "
"all the way down the page and across all pages. Then when the Bible is "
"printed, the printed text will be back to back and not show through from one "
"side of the page to the other. In the typesetting software, this can be "
"implemented by setting up a grid in the document, and then aligning all text "
"to this grid."
msgstr ""

#, php-format
msgid ""
"The space after the verse numbers would be the same and consistent. Bibledit-"
"Web exports the text to OpenDocument format using 'en spaces' after each "
"verse. This ensures a consistent width of the spaces after the verse "
"numbers. Superscript numerals could also be considered, though larger than "
"any note citations in the text. The size of the superscript would be between "
"70 and 80% of the size of the main text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The alignment of the drop caps chapter numbers to the text beside it is to "
"be consistent. There should be some space between the numbers and the text. "
"Drop cap characters should not be too large and not rise too far above the "
"height of the other letters on the first line. The top of the highest "
"letters should reach to about the same height. The drop cap characters in "
"the body of the text should not be indented."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The chapter divisions would also benefit from some more space between them "
"and the text of the preceding chapter. When there is no heading above a "
"chapter, it may be visually better to start the chapter number with a line "
"space before it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The amount of space given to the Bible book headings should not be too great."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subheadings should not appear squashed amongst the rest of the text and "
"would benefit from some space."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subheadings are an addition and not Scripture, so it is appropriate to put "
"these in italics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The space between the text and footnotes should not be too tight neither "
"unnecessarily large. Keep the gap between the references in the footer and "
"the main bock of text as consistent as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The footnotes and crossreferences should not have a large variation in how "
"far they finish from the foot of the page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the crossreferences it is pleasing to have the chapter and verse number "
"kept together with the book name, especially as the small font on long lines "
"gives scope for this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The columns should start at the same height and should be balanced at the "
"ends."
msgstr ""

msgid "The gap between the columns should be between 4 and 5 mm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The centre line dividing the two columns should start about level or very "
"slightly above the top of the highest ascenders on the first line of text in "
"a column and finish about level with the bottom of the lowest descenders on "
"the bottom line. The centre line may also be omitted, as most modern Bibles "
"do. The pages looks cleaner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Psalm headers need consistent spaces before and after and should be "
"positioned closer to the Psalm that follows than to the Psalm before."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A 10 mm margin is okay for the outer margin, and for the top and bottom "
"margin. The inner margin needs slightly more, e.g. 12 mm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For singable Psalms, readability would be helped by distinguishing the verse "
"numbers visually."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is helpful to distinguish the running head, perhaps by using a semi-bold "
"version of the same font."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One way in which the number of pages in a volume could be reduced without "
"loss of readability would be to choose a font with slightly shorter "
"ascenders and descenders and then tighten the leading (line spacing) "
"slightly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When producing PDF output, the text needs to be monochrome black, not black "
"consisting of three or four colours."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The last line of a verse or paragraph should not appear on its own at the "
"top of a column. The typesetting software will have a setting for 'orphans' "
"to control this. An elegant way of avoiding orphans is to increase or "
"decrease the tracking of the text. This is the overall spacing of the "
"letters in a paragraph or on a line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Avoid hyphenations in the headings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many book titles consist of a main title and a subtitle, like 'The gospel of "
"Matthew'. 'Matthew' is the main title, and the rest is the subtitle. It is "
"good if there is a clear contrast on size between these two. Say 24 points "
"bold for the main title, and 14 points regular for the subtitle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of hyphens used in a row should be few for enhanced readability. "
"The number of hyphens used in a row should not amount to more than three "
"consecutive hyphenated lines. At times a word that is now hyphenated could "
"be forced down onto the next line without opening up the gaps between the "
"words too much on the line above. Hyphenation should be set to the optimum "
"result for the column width but then it is usually necessary to go over "
"every page and make corrections manually."
msgstr ""

"The main page numbering should start at the first page of Genesis, or "
"Matthew in case of New Testaments."
msgstr ""

"To avoid what are sometimes referred to as 'rivers' in the text. This is "
"where large spaces between words cause rivers of white space to be seen "

"be used with discretion."
msgstr ""

msgid "As a general rule text will be justified on the left and the right."

"that it would display notes 1 to 5, out of 5 notes total."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can edit the display. That means that you can edit the number of notes "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Clicking [edit] takes you to a new page, called Edit Notes Display. This "

msgstr ""

msgid "The first thing that you can edit is how many notes will be selected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that refer to any passage, then notes will be selected "
"that refer to any passage, from Genesis to Revelation. But when you select "
"notes that refer to the current verse, then only those notes will be "
"selected that refer to the currently opened verse. In case you have Genesis "
"2.2 open in the navigator, then only notes that refer to that particular "
"verse are displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that have been edited at any time, then all notes would "
"be selected. But when you select notes that have been edited on Today, then "
"only today's notes are displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The note selection mechanism combines all selection methods that have been "
"set. If you select notes that refer to the current verse, for example, and "
"that have been edited today, and only those notes that both refer to the "
"current verse, and that also have been edited today, are displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are other notes selection mechanisms as well. See the relevant page "
"for all selection mechanisms. Things should be plain and there should be no "
"need for any further information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One thing that would need explanation would be the mechanism that selects "
"notes that contain certain text. This is intended to be used to search notes "
"for text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that contain Any text, then searching for text in the "
"note is not done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Searching for text can be done by selecting notes that contain specific "
"words or text. When you select this option, you will see that an entry "
"becomes visible. Search text should be entered there. Then the Save button "
"should be pressed. This is to save that search text. Or just pressing Enter "
"while the cursor is in that entry will do also."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you search for, for example, \"house\" (without the quotes), then notes "
"that contain the word \"house\" will be selected. Notes that contain the "
"word \"houses\" (in plural) would not be selected. To select this plural "
"form, you can use wildcards. Instead of entering \"house\", enter \"house*\" "
"Notice the asterisk. This will select notes that contains the word \"house\" "
"or \"houses\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also enter two or more words to search for. The search routine will "
"then do its best to select these notes that contain some or all of these "
"words. Notes that contain all words are given first, and notes that contains "
"only one or a few of the words will be given later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select notes that refer to the current verse, and then also search "
"for some text, then only the notes that refer to the current verse would be "
"searched. It is important to be aware of this. At times one may search for "
"words or phrases, and get zero results, yet he is sure that there should be "
"some results. This would happen because the user does not search the whole "
"Bible, but only the current verse. The same applies to other selection "
"mechanisms. Therefore, when searching notes for text, you may want to set "
"all other selection mechanisms to Any."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is more that can be said about searching notes. The wildcard operator "
"already has been mentioned. Here is a list of possible operators:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, when no opeerator specified, the word is optional, but the "
"result that contain it will be rated higher."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading plus sign indicates that this word must be present in every result "
"returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading minus sign indicates that this word must not be present in any "
"result returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the word's contribution "
"to the result relevance to be negative. It's useful for marking noise words. "
"A result that contains such a word will be rated lower than others, but will "
"not be excluded altogether, as it would be with the minus operator."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An asterisk is the wildcard operator. Unlike the other operators, it is "
"appended to the word, or fragment, not prepended. This means that if there "
"is a note with the word \"house\", and you search for \"*ouse\", this note "
"will not be selected. Yes, this is unusual, but this is how the database "
"search works. To minimize the pain of this, measures have been taken that if "
"you type any part of the word, the expected result will still be found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Double quotes at the beginning and end of a phrase, gives only the notes "
"that contain the complete phrase, as it was typed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each note can be assigned to somebody. The person to whom the note is "
"assigned then knows that action should be taken on this note. Or the person "
"can be automatically emailed if the note gets changed."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Consultation Notes can partly be operated by email."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Under the hood, Bibledit uses Git for collaboration. Git is a content "

msgid "Take your own data."
msgstr ""

msgid "Formatting the flash drive"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally a USB flash drive, as it comes out of the box, has been formatted "
"with a FAT filesystem. Such a filesystem is not supported for collaboration. "
"The stick needs to formatted to the ext3 or ext4 filesystem for "
"collaboration to work. How this is done will be described here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Insert the flash drive into a computer running GNU/Linux, and wait a little "
"till it gets mounted. It is supposed to mount automatically. If it does not "
"mount on its own, then automatic mounting needs to be set up. Setting up "
"automatic mounting goes beyond the scope of this tutorial."
msgstr ""

msgid "Open a terminal. In the terminal, give the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The output of this command can be something like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Looking through the list of mounting points, we assume that the USB flash "
"drive that was inserted mounts at /media/usbdisk. From there we can see that "
"the device is /dev/sdd1. Once we have that information, we are ready for the "
"next step."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before the stick can be formatted, it must be unmounted first. Issue the "
"following command to unmount the stick:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The 'sudo' in the command means that root privileges are needed to execute "
"the command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To format the USB drive to the ext3 filesystem, issue the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The formatting process will be visible and at the end some information about "
"it will be given. At this point it is important to see if no errors occurred."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The formatting command is very powerful. One could even format the main "
"drive of the computer, wiping out all information. Extreme care should be "
"used to ensure that the USB flash drive is going to be formatted, and "
"nothing else."
msgstr ""

msgid "Labelling the flash drive"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An internal label needs to be written to the USB drive. The reason of this "
"is so as to make sure that this drive will always mount at the same mounting "
"point. In this tutorial we write the label 'usbstick' to it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We take it that the same device is being used as we used for formatting the "
"drive. That is device /dev/sdd1. To write the label to the drive, issue the "
"following two commands:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the label has been written to it, remove the USB flash drive from the "
"computer, and insert it again. It should now mount to the name of the label. "
"In this case it should mount under /media/usbstick."
msgstr ""

msgid "This can be verified with command 'df':"
msgstr ""

msgid "The output of this command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This shows that it now mounts under the new name."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating the repository on the flash drive"
msgstr ""

msgid "The USB flash drive will hold the data repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make this flash drive fit for collaboration, there are a few steps to be "
"taken. These steps are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. The first step will be to create a directory for the repository, and to "
"make that directory writable. If we assume that the flash drive mounts at "
"/media/usbstick, then the command to create a directory called 'repository' "
"is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice the ' sudo'  command, which means that this usually needs to be done "
"by user root. If this is done by an ordinary user, permission would be "
"denied."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the directory for the repository is there, this directory needs to be "
"made writable for ordinary users. This is the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note the 'sudo' again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now it is time to check whether the USB drive is writable. We do this by "
"trying to create a file in the repository. If this succeeds, then it is "
"writable. Here's the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This command should complete without errors. After that the file needs to be "
"removed again:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"2. The second step is to make the USB stick the current working directory. "
"Type:"
msgstr ""

msgid "3. The next step is to create a repository on the USB stick."
msgstr ""

msgid "To create a shared repository on the USB stick, type:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Git will respond saying that an empty shared Git repository has been created."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"4. The last step is to make the repository accessible to the web server's "
"user. To do this, type the following two commands:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All steps have now been taken. Before removing the flash drive, ensure that "
"the data gets written to it, by issuing the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This finishes setting up the repository on the USB flash drive."
