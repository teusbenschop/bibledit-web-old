Script to update translations from Launchpad.

#!/bin/bash

# Download and integrate translation strings into Bibledit-Web.
# Download translations in MO format from launchpad.net, 
# and store these in ~/documents/dev/bibledit/web/web/locale
# The script will unpack and integrate these. 

cd
cd documents/dev/bibledit-pot
# bzr init
bzr pull lp:~teusbenschop/bibledit/bibledit-pot
cp web/web/pot/*.po ~/documents/dev/bibledit/web/web/locale
cd
cd documents/dev/bibledit/web/web/locale
tar zxf launchpad-export.tar.gz
rm templates/*.pot
rmdir templates
cd

# End.


Testing the gettext system.
Presuming that Bibledit-Web is installed in /var/www/bibledit-web,
run these few lines in the shell: 

export LANGUAGE=nl
export TEXTDOMAINDIR=/var/www/bibledit-web/locale
gettext -d bibledit Bible

Update:
It appeared that the gettext system didn't work well.
In Chinese, the word "Bible" appears as ?? while it should be 聖經.
Therefore the localization was moved to Zend_Translate.
That works well.
