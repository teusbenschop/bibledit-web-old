<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Note the 'sudo' again.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Now it is time to check whether the USB drive is writable. We do this by trying to create a file in the repository. If this succeeds, then it is writable. Here's the command:") ?></p>
<pre>touch /media/usbstick/repository/testfile</pre>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("This command should complete without errors. After that the file needs to be removed again:") ?></p>
<pre>rm /media/usbstick/repository/testfile</pre>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("2. The second step is to make the USB stick the current working directory. Type:") ?></p>
<pre>cd /media/usbstick/repository</pre>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("3. The next step is to create a repository on the USB stick.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("To create a shared repository on the USB stick, type:") ?></p>
<pre>git --bare init --shared</pre>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("Git will respond saying that an empty shared Git repository has been created.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("4. The last step is to make the repository accessible to the web server's user. To do this, type the following two commands:") ?></p>
<pre>sudo chown -R <?php echo $this->username ?>:<?php echo $this->username ?> *</pre>
<pre>sudo chmod -R 0777 *</pre>
<p><?php echo Locale_Translate::_("All steps have now been taken. Before removing the flash drive, ensure that the data gets written to it, by issuing the command:") ?></p>
