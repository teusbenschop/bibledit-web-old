msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the label has been written to it, remove the USB flash drive from the "

msgid "The USB flash drive will hold the data repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make this flash drive fit for collaboration, there are a few steps to be "
"taken. These steps are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. The first step will be to create a directory for the repository, and to "
"make that directory writable. If we assume that the flash drive mounts at /"
"media/usbstick, then the command to create a directory called 'repository' "
"is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice the ' sudo'  command, which means that this usually needs to be done "
"by user root. If this is done by an ordinary user, permission would be "
"denied."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once the directory for the repository is there, this directory needs to be "
"made writable for ordinary users. This is the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note the 'sudo' again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now it is time to check whether the USB drive is writable. We do this by "
"trying to create a file in the repository. If this succeeds, then it is "
"writable. Here's the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This command should complete without errors. After that the file needs to be "
"removed again:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"2. The second step is to make the USB stick the current working directory. "
"Type:"
msgstr ""

msgid "3. The next step is to create a repository on the USB stick."
msgstr ""

msgid "To create a shared repository on the USB stick, type:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Git will respond saying that an empty shared Git repository has been created."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"4. The last step is to make the repository accessible to the web server's "
"user. To do this, type the following two commands:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All steps have now been taken. Before removing the flash drive, ensure that "
"the data gets written to it, by issuing the command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This finishes setting up the repository on the USB flash drive."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are a variety of methods for collaboration. The administrator who will "
"set it all up needs to have sufficient knowledge of information technology."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bibledit-Web stores all data locally. When collaboration is enabled, it also "

"shared between the various translators and other users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Under the hood, Bibledit uses Git for collaboration. Git is a content "
"manager. The user does not notice that Git is used. He does not operate it "
"directly. The only thing that the manager needs to do at regular times is to "
"'Send/Receive' the Bible. After having done that, the changes in the Bible, "
"made by the other translators or users, appear on his screen too. And the "
"changes made by himself get stored in the repository, and if the other users "

msgid "Not in paper form, not in digital form."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is enslaved, again."

msgid ""

msgid ""
"He chooses the GNU Free Documentation License as an appropriate license for "

msgid ""
"He is of the view that it is appropriate for the Word of God to be created "

msgid ""
"The GNU Free Documentation License allows noncommercial distribution of the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is a good thing because this enables anyone to print the Bible and give "
"it to someone else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GNU Free Documentation License allows commercial distribution of the "
"Bible by any publisher who accepts the license."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is good, because it maximizes the distribution potential by allowing "
"sales of printed Bibles."
msgstr ""

msgid "It also harnesses the profit motive for distribution."
msgstr ""

msgid "It limits overcharging with competitive pressure on prices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GNU Free Documentation License allows to update the Bible, provided the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a good thing because it allows legitimate updates, revisions, "
"adaptations with no hassle to the translators and no delay for getting "
"permission."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A disadvantage is that changes can be made by people who might not be "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is some fear that granting permission to make revisions would make it "

msgstr ""

msgid "But copyright law is not about preventing this."
msgstr ""

msgid "If anyone wants to make those changes, he would still do it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is no need for this fear, because it is God who protects His own work."
msgstr ""

msgid "He makes clear what is a good translation, and what is not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a Bible Society is so protective about a Bible, so as not to grant a "
"license to make revisions, then there is a bigger danger than that of heresy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The bigger danger is that the copyright holder holds on to the Bible, or "
"disappears, or dies, or fails to be a good steward of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nobody would be allowed to improve or update the text."
msgstr ""

msgid "Trust God."
msgstr ""

msgid "He takes care of His Word,"
msgstr ""

msgid "He deals with anyone who might abuse it."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Bible Society says:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We own copyright, not in any way to restrict distribution, but to preserve "
"the text."
msgstr ""

msgid "Protecting the text may at times restrict distribution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the Bible must be distributed by us, or under our supervision."
msgstr ""

msgid "We have made a big investment in the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nobody may improve it without our authority."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If anybody gives us details as to where the Bible can be improved, they can "
"improve it, but only when we agree."

msgid "This Bible is our property."

msgid "We share it."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is not entirely ours, so there is a shared property."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Free Documentation License is good in an ideal world."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "The Bible Society has made such a reliable and good Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is it not worthy of being spread as far and wide as possible?"
msgstr ""

msgid "A restrictive license confines the Word to one publisher, one channel."
msgstr ""

msgid "A free license opens up the Word to being spread by more channels."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the license is restrictive, it is not the bad people who are afraid of "
"illegally copying the Word of God, making changes, then publish it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But it's the good people who would be worried to violate copyright law when "
"spreading the Word, thinking that God's blessing cannot be on something "

msgid ""
"The free license does not aid bad people much, but it assists good people in "

msgid "Scrum-based Translation"
msgstr ""

msgid "What is Scrum-based translation?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A translation team that works with Scrum frequently releases portions of "
"translated Scripture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This makes it clear to involved parties where the translation project is "
"going."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It enables the translation team to make course corrections based on the "
"facts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Burndown charts and the product backlog provide the product owner and others "
"with a permanent overview over the translation status and progress."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Scrum is an agile process that enables self-organizing translation teams to "
"deliver high translation output and accuracy in a short time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using iterative translation, it releases portions of translated Scripture "
"every iteration, that is, every month."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the end of the every sprint, anyone can see the translated portion, and "
"decide whether to release it to the congregations and community for feedback "
"or continue to enhance it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The introduction and the following explanation just outlines the mechanics "
"of Scrum-based Translation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It does not make clear what difficulties and issues you will run into trying "
"to implement it."
msgstr ""

msgid "It only hints at the agile spirit that's required to make it work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're interested in implementing Scrum-based translation, do some "
"reading, watch videos, follow a course, find a mentor or coach."
msgstr ""

msgid "Product Owner"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Product Owner represents the stakeholders."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He or she is the voice of the target audience, that is the Bible reader."
msgstr ""

msgid "He understands the requirements for the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Product Owner may also be a group of people in a committee."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He is responsible for ensuring that the team delivers accuracy and "
"reliability to the Bible translation."
msgstr ""

msgid "He knows about accuracy and reliability."
msgstr ""

msgid "He defines items that focus on desired features."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"He makes decisions as to whether to implement footnotes or leave them out."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the same way, he defines other features, like headers, introductions, or "
"decides to leave them out."
msgstr ""

msgid "He decides about use or non-use of a dialect."
msgstr ""

msgid "He sets the priorities for the work to be done."
msgstr ""

msgid "He adds the items to the product backlog."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scrum teams should have one Product Owner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Product Owner may be part of the Translation Team, but it is recommended "
"that his role not be combined with the role of Scrum Master."
msgstr ""

msgid "Release Planning"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The release planning shows which parts of the Bible will be translated and "
"delivered during which Sprint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is convenient to define a Sprint in months, so that the release planning "
"mentions January, February, and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is often helpful to stick the release planning to the wall so that "
"everybody can see the grand picture."
msgstr ""

msgid "The advantages of a release planning are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. It gives the team a common vision about what needs to be achieved, and "
"when."
msgstr ""

msgid "2. It guides the team to make decisions during detailed planning."
msgstr ""

msgid "3. It helps prioritize the actions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"4. It resolves conflicts and guides the teams toward the right balance on "
"trade-offs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Release each completed Bible book to the community and get their feedback."
msgstr ""

msgid "This implements the important principle of continual improvement."
msgstr ""

msgid "The release planning is a simple way of doing top-down planning."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is an estimate, simple and quick to do."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is based on the Product Backlog."
msgstr ""

msgid "Product Backlog"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The product backlog is an ordered list of requirements that is maintained "
"for the Bible translation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It consists of translation tasks, checking tasks, testing tasks, "
"comprehension tasks, whatever needs to be done to deliver a reliable "
"manuscript."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Product Owner prioritizes the items on this list."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is used to determine the work for the next sprints."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each item has an associated estimated time to complete."
msgstr ""

msgid "A sprint typically takes one month."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is where the translaton work (translate, review, approve, test) occurs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each member of the team translates independently and in a responsible manner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In case a translator is sure of a required change, he enters it without "
"consulting others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a translator thinks a proposed change needs discussion, he notifies his "
"colleagues."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All members of the translation team review the changes made by the team."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is to make sure that all changes are reviewed by all members, that no "
"mistakes occur."
msgstr ""

msgid "The reviews take place every day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This way of working is based on personal responsibility and mutual trust."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It speeds up the translation procedure because there's more actual "
"translation work going on, and less discussions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The newer members of the team learn from the more experienced ones through "
"the daily reviews."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bibledit-Web has the concept of daily Change Notifications."
msgstr ""

msgid "A member can opt to receive the Change Notifications through email."
msgstr ""

msgid "This email can be viewed online also."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Or a member can opt to have the Change Notifications generated for him "
"online, and can review and approve them there."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Planning Meeting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During this meeting the team selects the portions to translate, review and "
"test it believes it can commit to in a sprint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The team breaks the portions down into tasks and provided estimates for "
"those tasks as to the time it takes to complete them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Backlog"
msgstr ""

msgid "The sprint backlog is a list of tasks to be completed in a sprint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The tasks are created by breaking down the product backlog items during the "
"planning meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid "The tasks have estimates in hours or days associated with them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a team it is vitally important to have a clear goal to work towards."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thus everybody is focused on the desired outcome, and keeps a good pace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Without a clear goal, the team may still do a lot of things and work hard, "
"but the produced results may have the desired value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Team"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The team consistes of the Bible translators, their assistants, and the "
"consultants."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The team organizes itself to carry out the work and deliver a reliable and "
"good Bible translation."
msgstr ""

msgid "The team is quick but does not hurry."
msgstr ""

msgid "The team goes fast, but always has an eye on translation quality."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scrum Master"
msgstr ""

msgid "The scrum master organizes the translation process."
msgstr ""

msgid "He or she keeps track of the progress of the translation team."
msgstr ""

msgid "He removes obstacles from the path of the team."
msgstr ""

msgid "Daily Scrum Meeting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On each day of a sprint, the Bible translation team holds daily meetings."
msgstr ""

msgid "These meetings are called: Daily scrum meetings."
msgstr ""

msgid "The scrum meetings are held in the same place and at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid "The meetings are typically held in front of Task Board."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The daily scrum meeting is best held in the morning, because it assists in "
"setting the context for the work of that day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During the meeting, all members stand, as this keeps the discussion short "
"and relevant."
msgstr ""

msgid "The scrum meeting is strictly time-boxed to 15 minutes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a difference between people who are 'committed' to the Bible "
"translation project, and those who are 'involved' in it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scrum affords special status to those who are committed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many teams enforce a rule in which only those who are committed are allowed "
"to talk during the daily scrum meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid "All team members are required to attend the scrum meetings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Scrum Master and the and Product Owner (usually the Bible Translation "
"Manager) are committed team members."
msgstr ""

msgid "They are expected to attend and participate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Anyone else, for example a Church leader, a Committee member, or a "
"Translator from another team, is allowed to attend but is there to listen "
"only."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This makes the daily scrum meeting an excellent way for a scrum team to "
"disseminate information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are interested in hearing the status of the project, attend that "
"day's meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The scrum meeting is not the place for solving problems or resolving issues."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Issues that are raised are usually dealt with by one or two team members "
"immediately after the scrum."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During the daily Scrum, each team member answers the following three "
"questions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "What did you do yesterday?"
msgstr ""

msgid "What are you going to do today?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Are there any impediments in your way?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Scrum Master asks each team member to answer these questions, the member "
"speaks, the Scrum Master thanks the member, and then goes to the next member."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By focusing on what each person did yesterday and will do today, the team "
"gains an understanding of what work has been done and what work remains."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The daily scrum meeting is not a status update meeting in which the boss is "
"finding out about who is slow in his work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a translator says: Today, I will prepare chapter 10 and 11 of Matthew, "
"everyone knows that in tomorrow's meeting, he will say whether or not he did "
"finish."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This has the wonderful effect of helping a team realize the significance of "
"these commitments, and that their commitments are to each other, and not to "
"anyone else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any impediments that are raised in the daily scrums become the Scrum "
"Master's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typical impediments are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "My ... broke and I need a new one today."
msgstr ""

msgid "I still haven't got the ... I requested a month ago."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I'm struggling to understand ... and would like to discuss it with someone."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ... has asked me to work on something else for a few days."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In cases where the Scrum Master cannot remove these impediments directly "
"himself, he still takes responsibility for making sure someone on the team "
"does quickly resolve the issue."
msgstr ""

msgid "Every day a different person leads the daily scrum meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid "This gets the entire team involved."
msgstr ""

msgid "It opens up new channels for communication."
msgstr ""

msgid "It builds trust between the Translators and the Scrum Master."
msgstr ""

msgid "Team members can learn from one another's techniques."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Scrum Master ensures to set a good example for leading the daily scrum "
"meeting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The scrum master uses the information from the meeting to update the "
"burndown chart illustrating progress."
msgstr ""

msgid "Side conversations are taken offline."
msgstr ""

msgid "External reference"
msgstr ""

msgid "Burn down chart"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus "
"time."
msgstr ""

msgid "The outstanding work is on the vertical axis."
msgstr ""

msgid "The days of the sprint are on the horizontal axis."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Review"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Product Owner looks through the sprint’s work and provides feedback."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Translators may demonstrate features."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Team owns up to deficiencies with the translation, helping to build "
"trust with the Product Owner."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprint Retrospective"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Team reviews what went well and what went poorly."
msgstr ""

msgid "They use retrospection techniques to find potential for improvement."
msgstr ""

msgid "They pick one or two areas to focus for improvement."
msgstr ""

msgid "Several pages have a Passage Navigator on top."
msgstr ""

msgid "It consists of the name of the book, the chapter, and the verse."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Matthew 1:1."
msgstr ""

msgid "The navigator enables you to go to another passage."
msgstr ""

msgid "Click on the name of the book to navigate to another book."
msgstr ""

msgid "In the same way you can click on the chapter and on the verse."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also use the keyboard to navigate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Press Ctrl-G, enter the new passage, for example Mat 2 3, and press Enter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also enter the name of the book without chapter and verse, for "
"example, Genesis, and it will go to that book."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Or enter chapter and verse, for example 10 2, and it goes to that passage in "
"the current book."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When entering just one number, for example 2, it will go to verse 2 in the "
"current chapter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Or enter Luke 10, to go to Luke chapter 10."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enter nothing or + to go to the next verse."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enter - to go to the previous verse."
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Escape to cancel any navigation operation."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Navigator shows two arrows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "goes back in the navigation history."
msgstr ""

msgid "goes forward in the navigation history."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are also keyboard shortcuts for it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some pages display one or more clickable passages."

"An asterisk is the wildcard operator. Unlike the other operators, it is "

msgid ""
"The following needs consideration if the Bible includes more than one book."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Does the next book follow on the same page on which the previous book "
"finished, or do the books follow on from one another in a different way?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whatever method is chosen, it needs to be applied consistently throughout "
"the Bible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Line spacing should be consistent throughout and should be placed line on "
"line across all pages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It means that they should all line up with each other all the way down the "
"page and across all pages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then when the Bible is printed, the printed text will be back to back and "
"not show through from one side of the page to the other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the typesetting software, this can be implemented by setting up a grid in "
"the document, and then aligning all text to this grid."
msgstr ""

msgid "The space after the verse numbers would be the same and consistent."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bibledit-Web exports the text to OpenDocument format using 'en spaces' after "
"each verse."
msgstr ""

msgid "This ensures a consistent width of the spaces after the verse numbers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The verse numbers should be set closer to the text that follows rather than "
"half-way between."
msgstr ""

msgid "Many fonts have half spaces and hair spaces that can be used for this."
msgstr ""

msgid "Or set the kerning to a specific amount for the verse numbers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Superscript numerals could also be considered for verse numbers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They are less intrusive while at the same time just as readable and easily "
"found if they are not made too small."
msgstr ""

msgid "They should be larger than any note citations in the text."
msgstr ""

#, php-format
msgid ""
"The size of the superscript would be between 70 and 80% of the size of the "
"main text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The alignment of the drop caps chapter numbers to the text beside it is to "
"be consistent."
msgstr ""

msgid "There should be some space between the numbers and the text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Drop cap characters should not be too large and not rise too far above the "
"height of the other letters on the first line."
msgstr ""

msgid "The top of the highest letters should reach to about the same height."
msgstr ""

msgid "The drop cap characters in the body of the text should not be indented."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The chapter divisions would also benefit from some more space between them "
"and the text of the preceding chapter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When there is no heading above a chapter, it may be visually better to start "
"the chapter number with a line space before it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The amount of space given to the Bible book headings should not be too much."
msgstr ""

msgid "But they can do with some space above and below them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subheadings should not appear squashed amongst the rest of the text and "
"would benefit from some space."
msgstr ""

msgid "Subheadings do not need to be set on the grid."
msgstr ""

msgid "They are much better set a little closer to the text that follows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subheadings are an addition and not Scripture, so it is appropriate to put "
"these in italics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The space between the text and footnotes should not be too tight neither "
"unnecessarily large."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep the gap between the references in the footer and the main bock of text "
"as consistent as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The footnotes and crossreferences should not have a large variation in how "
"far they finish from the foot of the page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the crossreferences it is pleasing to have the chapter and verse number "
"kept together with the book name, especially as the small font on long lines "
"gives scope for this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The columns should start at the same height and should be balanced at the "
"ends."
msgstr ""

msgid "The gap between the columns should be between 4 and 5 mm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The centre line dividing the two columns should start about level or very "
"slightly above the top of the highest ascenders on the first line of text in "
"a column and finish about level with the bottom of the lowest descenders on "
"the bottom line."
msgstr ""

msgid "The centre line may also be omitted, as most modern Bibles do."
msgstr ""

msgid "The pages looks cleaner then."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Psalm headers need consistent spaces before and after and should be "
"positioned closer to the Psalm that follows than to the Psalm before."
msgstr ""

msgid "A 10 mm margin is okay for the top and bottom margins."
msgstr ""

msgid "A 12 mm margin is good for the outer margin."
msgstr ""

msgid "The inner margin needs slightly more, for example 14 mm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For singable Psalms, readability would be helped by distinguishing the verse "
"numbers visually."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is helpful to distinguish the running head, perhaps by using a semi-bold "
"version of the same font."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One way in which the number of pages in a volume could be reduced without "
"loss of readability would be to choose a font with slightly shorter "
"ascenders and descenders and then tighten the leading (line spacing) "
"slightly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When producing PDF output, the text needs to be monochrome black, not black "
"consisting of three or four colours."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The last line of a verse or paragraph should not appear on its own at the "
"top of a column."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The typesetting software will have a setting for 'orphans' to control this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An elegant way of avoiding orphans is to increase or decrease the tracking "
"of the text."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the overall spacing of the letters in a paragraph or on a line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Avoid hyphenations in the headings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many book titles consist of a main title and a subtitle, like 'The gospel of "
"Matthew'."
msgstr ""

msgid "'Matthew' is the main title, and the rest is the subtitle."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is good if there is a clear contrast on size between these two."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Say 24 points bold for the main title, and 14 points regular for the "
"subtitle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of hyphens used in a row should be few for enhanced readability."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of hyphens used in a row should not amount to more than three "
"consecutive hyphenated lines."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At times a word that is now hyphenated could be forced down onto the next "
"line without opening up the gaps between the words too much on the line "
"above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Hyphenation should be set to the optimum result for the column width but "
"then it is usually necessary to go over every page and make corrections "
"manually."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The main page numbering should start at the first page of Genesis, or "
"Matthew in case of New Testaments."
msgstr ""

msgid "To avoid what are sometimes referred to as 'rivers' in the text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is where large spaces between words cause rivers of white space to be "
"seen running through the text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The use of hyphenation or tracking adjustments are tools that can be used to "
"minimise the problem."
msgstr ""

msgid "But as always they need to be used with discretion."
msgstr ""

msgid "As a general rule text will be justified on the left and the right."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A word, part of a word, or very short line should not appear by itself at "
"the end of a paragraph."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This result in less much white space between paragraphs or at the bottom of "
"a page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The main page numbering starts at the first page of the text of the "
"Scripture."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This first page of Scripture starts on the recto (right side of a two page "
"spread) for left to right reading scripts and the verso (left side of a two "
"page spread) for right to left scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to subheadings starting in a new column, there may be spaces at the foot "
"of pages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They can be filled by carefully adjusting tracking in one of the paragraphs."
msgstr ""

msgid "The paragraph would then take up an extra line to fill that space."
