Postpone displaying the header for two reasons:
1. The logged-in state is likely to change during this script.
   Therefore the header should wait till the new state is known.
2. The script may forward the user to another page.
   Therefore no output should be sent so the forward headers work.


This script can have several functions:

1. Display login form.
The user is not logged in. 
The standard form is displayed.

2. Incorrect credentials entered.
The user did not enter correct credentials.
The login form is displayed, with an error description.

3. Forward to URL.
The script is called with a query for where to forward the user to.
