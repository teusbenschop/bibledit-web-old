<p>Bibledit-Web needs a timer for running scheduled tasks through program <code>crontab</code>.</p>
<p>The following two scheduled tasks needs to be set in the <code>cron</code> scheduler with read and write access to user <code><?php echo $webuser; ?></code>:</p>
<p><code><?php echo $timerSignature; ?></code></p>
<p><code><?php echo $tasksSignature; ?></code></p>
<p>Some hosting providers prefer not to have scheduled tasks on their web server. Install it manually in such cases. Run <code>crontab -e</code> as user <code>root</code>, and enter the two lines given above.</p>
