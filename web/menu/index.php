/*
This generates a start menu.

It is based on an array of all possible menu entries.
It reads the access levels of those entries.
It only keeps those menu entries the currently logged-in user has access to.

It originally self-organized the entries such that the ones used most often came earlier in the menu.
But menu entries moving around does no good. It creates confusion instead.
Therefore it was removed again.
